h1. Curl::Multi

h1. &#x2192; ‘curl-multi’

h2. What

<code syntax="ruby">Curl::Multi</code> provides very high-level Ruby bindings
for the libcurl multi interface.

It was originally written for use by
"www.causesonfacebook.com":http://www.causesonfacebook.com/ to process many
concurrent http requests. <code syntax="ruby">Curl::Multi</code> is written and
maintanied by Kristján Pétursson and Keith Rarick.

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="sh">$ sudo gem install curl-multi</pre>

h2. The basics

<pre syntax="ruby">
require 'curl-multi'
curl = Curl::Multi.new
on_success = lambda do |body|
  puts body
end
on_failure = lambda do |ex|
  puts 'Failure.'
  puts ex
end
curl.get('http://www.example.org/', on_success, on_failure)
curl.select([], []) while curl.size > 0
</pre>

There's not much more to the interface. A good thing, too, because we don't
really have any documentation yet. Patches are most welcome!
